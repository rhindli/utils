You can add to openvpn configuration file (.ovpn) the following to not route all trafic via vpn but only 
lets say 192.168.1.x and 192.168.10.x and 192.168.20.33


pull-filter ignore "redirect-gateway"
route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 vpn_gateway
route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 vpn_gateway
route 192.168.20.33 255.255.255.255 vpn_gateway
